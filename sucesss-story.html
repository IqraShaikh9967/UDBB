      <div class="story">As the head of a small NGO, we were devastated when one of our long-time residents passed away. We lacked the resources to give him a proper burial, and the emotional weight was heavy on our team. That’s when UDBB stepped in — not only did they handle the burial with complete respect and dignity, but they also managed all the logistics and expenses. It felt like a huge burden lifted off our shoulders. They treated our resident like family, and for that, we will always be grateful.</div>

      <div class="story">I never imagined I would find my brother after months of searching. Through UDBB’s database of unclaimed bodies, I was able to identify him and give him the peaceful farewell he deserved. Their team stood by me in every formal procedure, making it all less painful. I will always be thankful.</div>
